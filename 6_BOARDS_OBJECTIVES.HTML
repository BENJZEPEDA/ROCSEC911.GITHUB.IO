            1. NETWORK SECURITY A network security specialist is a professional who focuses on ensuring information confidentiality, integrity and availability. Network security utilizes proactive techniques, including defense-in-depth and layered security, to mitigate or eliminate vulnerabilities in information systems and to protect against potential exploitation. This may include network and application penetration testing, software and hardware reverse engineering as well as developing exploits for identified vulnerabilities. Security professionals possess intimate knowledge of critical business components. The Network Security degree reflects the application of theory and is aligned with industry standards and guidelines. It provides students with the opportunity to synthesize and apply the vital skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the cyber security workforce. NETWORK SECURITY DEGREE OBJECTIVES 1. Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components, connections to outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and security components in the design. 2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners, vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch management, auditing and assessment. 3. Construct, implement and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing, analysis and assessment. 32 4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy, assessments or troubleshooting procedures. 5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements that pertain to information security. 6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security based threats, risks, malicious activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity and availability
            2. NETWORK ENGINEERING The evolution of todayâ€™s technology has seen a tremendous increase in the number and types of networked devices, network topologies, cloud implementations and the general hybridization of networks for all of the connectivity and communications needs. Highly skilled Network Engineers are responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of our networked systems to include the integration of new technologies. A strong foundational knowledge of network and systems engineering concepts form the basis on which the advanced topics are built. Key concepts such as routing, switching, server operating systems, email systems, IOT, IP telephony, wireless, cloud, and virtualization will be explored in detail. Graduates will demonstrate a mastery of network architecture and be fluent in system and network device administration, cloud computing, and virtualization technology. This degree will prepare you with the skills required to become a successful network or systems engineer/administrator. NETWORK ENGINEERING DEGREE OBJECTIVES 1. Translate physical and organizational needs into network design(s) that fully address and support logical, physical, and/or virtualized operational requirements. 2. Implement, support, and evaluate network services (active directory, email, DNS, servers, clients and data storage), routed and switched network infrastructures (wired and wireless) that incorporate networking concepts and industry best practices. 3. Design network architectures that incorporate emerging networking technologies. 4. Produce professional and accurate visualizations and documentation related to network architecture and services. 5. Given cost and operational parameters, design network, hardware and system options with evaluations and recommendations of how they meet the requirements of specific projects. 6. Design and implement a secure network infrastructure using industry best practices
            3. TECHNOLOGY FORENSICS A technology forensics specialist is an information technology professional who supports the military, corporate, law enforcement and legal communities in the investigation and analysis of digital data. Students in the Technology Forensics degree program will learn methods to obtain and document digital information, determine how information was compromised, trace attribution of malicious code and reverse engineer data to develop mitigations and countermeasures. Graduates from the program will have both the technical skills for recovering evidence and the presentation skills to provide both detailed technical and summary data to interested parties. Above all, this program will focus on learning the highly technical and cutting-edge technologies affecting IT systems today and tomorrow. This program will prepare students to anticipate new and emerging technologies so they can be successful within the rapidly evolving computer forensic environment and the increasingly complex threat landscape. TECHNOLOGY FORENSICS DEGREE OBJECTIVES 1. Articulate the complexity of and apply thinking skills to how the network and application infrastructure affects technology forensics investigations and incident response procedures. 2. Identify and apply in a forensics context the various topologies, standards, technologies and protocols employed in computer systems, including file system formats and their attributes. 3. Evaluate, select, and deploy computer forensic measures for the response, mitigation and analysis of a security incident pertaining to digital artifacts and how information was compromised. 4. Analyze and evaluate the current investigative and legal aspects of information and computer forensics including electronic discovery, deposition, litigation and corporate personnel processes. 5. Evaluate and execute the strategies, methodologies, technique, and state-of-the-art forensics tools for the preservation of digital evidence on computer systems, network systems and other electronic devices. 6. Create tracking processes to follow the trail of electronic evidence through digital systems, including documentation, formal reporting and presentation.
